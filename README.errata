 - use bigger EEPROM (1kbit far too small)
 - LED drivers are open-source/open-drain; must make sure
   proper pulldowns are present on LVC driver inputs!
   Either:
     - pull-down higher impedance than internal pull-up
     - pull-down in addition to lower impedance external pull-up 
     - pull-down only activated after lan9254 comes out of config
       (e.g., driven by FPGA pins).
